ZUUIRevealController
=======

A Facebook inspired custom iOS ViewControllerContainer that enables to have a UIViewController on top of another. The rear view can be revealed either by slowly panning the finger across the front view's NavigationBar, by quickly flicking it left or right or simply by tapping the 'Reveal' button.

Features
=======

- Uses iOS 5 new UIViewController containment.
- ...but now also works on iOS 4!
- High attention to detail. (Dynamically generated shadows, slowing-overdraw with bounce-back, "Magnetic Edges" with carefully executed animations).
- Highly flexible. - Very low coupling.
- Elegant protocol. Receive callbacks when certain events (are about to) occur and control the entire flow!
- Easily adjustable settings via defines. (Trigger levels for "Magnetic Edges", velocity for "instant reveal" etc.)
- Universal (iPad & iPhone) working both in landscape and portrait mode.
- Easy to read code with low complexity.
- Behaves almost exactly like the Facebook implementation.
